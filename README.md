## Usage

### Pre Requisites

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

Before being able to run any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set a BIP-39 compatible mnemonic as the `MNEMONIC`
environment variable. You can follow the example in `.env.example` or start with the following command:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

If you don't already have a mnemonic, you can use this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to generate one. An alternative, if you have [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed is to use the `cast wallet new-mnemonic` command.

Then, install all needed dependencies - please **_make sure to use Node v20_** or more recent:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
pnpm compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
pnpm typechain
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat - this will run the tests on a local hardhat node in mocked mode (i.e the FHE operations and decryptions will be simulated by default):

```sh
pnpm test
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
pnpm lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
pnpm lint:ts
```


### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
pnpm clean
```
